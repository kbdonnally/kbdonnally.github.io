	<p>Welcome! This intake form will allow me to get a sense for your project, as well as some crucial information to prepare us for when we meet. As always, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to email me at <a href="mailto:kbdonnally@gmail.com">kbdonnally@gmail.com</a>.</p>
	<p>The form itself is broken up into four parts: Contact Information, Project Logistics (budget, due dates, etc.), Project Information (what's the project about?), and Style Information (preferences on how things should look). It should take about 20 minutes to complete. If you'd prefer to do so in a new browser tab, you can do so by clicking <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLLtKFtWCYmRposqM3gGEMUcbz1Im86qz7_OZ-_5C53XQ1dA/viewform?usp=sf_link" aria-label="Click here to open the form in a new tab">here</a>.</p>
