We seek to explain and understand basic Marxist topics over the course of this series. It is by no means a substitute for *Capital*, but *is* a good complement for it when seeking to understand its core topics.

Topics, which will display as links once they've been written about:

1. Value
	- Will be quoting from Marx quite heavily here
2. Labor theory of value
	- Ditto, and may actually meld into #1 for a longer piece
3. Surplus-value
	- Need labor theory of value behind it, as well as the concept of capitalist exploitation of workers, to understand this as an exact measure of exploitation (*not* profit!).
	- Absolute & relative surplus-value
4. Variable and constant capital
