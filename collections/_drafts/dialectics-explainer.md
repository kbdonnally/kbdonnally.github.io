## Planning Phase:

- *Anti-Duhring:*
	- **XII:** Dialectics. Quantity & Quality
	- **XIII:** Dialectics. Negation of the Negation

### Chapter 12: Quantity & Quality

- "As long as we consider things as at rest and lifeless, each one by itself, alongside and after each other, we do not run up against any contradictions in them. We find certain qualities which are partly common to, partly different from, and even contradictory to each other, but which in the last-mentioned case are distributed among different objects and therefore contain no contradiction within." (p73)
	- "Inside the limits of this sphere of observation we can get along on the basis of the usual, **metaphysical mode of thought**."
	- "But the position is quite diffrent as soon as we consider things in their motion, their change, their life, their reciprocal influence on one another. Then we immediately become involved in contradictions. **Motion itself is a contradiction**: even simple mechanical change of position can only come about through a body being at once and the same time both in one place and in another place, being in one and the same place and also not in it." (p73)
	- "**And the continuous origination and simultaneous solution of this contradiction is precisely what motion is.**" (p74)
- "If simple mechanical change of position contains a contradiction this is even more true of the higher forms of motion of matter, and especially of organic life and its development. We saw above that life consists precisely and primarily in this - that a being is in each moment itself and yet something else." (p74)
	- "**Life is therefore also a contradiction** which is present in things u processes themselves, and which constantly originates and resolves itself; and as soon as the contradiction ceases, life, too, comes to an end, and death steps in." (p74)
	- "We likewise saw that also in the sphere of thought we could not escape contradictions, and that for example the **contradiction between man's inherently unlimited capacity for knowledge and its actual presence only in men who are externally limited** and possess limited cognition finds its solution finds its solution in what is - at least practically, for us - an endless succession of generations, in infinite progress." (p74)
- "In its operations with variable quantities mathematics itself enters the field of dialectics ... **The relation between the mathematics of variable and the mathematics of constant quantities is in general the same as the relation of dialectical to metaphysical thought**." (p74)
- "And it is only after this, and in the course of still further explanations elucidating and substantiating the fact that not every petty sum of values is enough to be transformable into capital, but that in this respect each period of development and each branch of industry has its definite minimum sum, that Marx observes: 'Here, as in natural science, *is shown* the correctness of the law discovered by Hegel in his *Logic*, that **merely quantitative changes past a certain point pass into qualitative differences**." (p75)
	- *Important!*
	- "Marx says: The fact that a sum of values can be transformed into capital only when it has reached a certain size, varying according to the cirumstances, but in each case definite minimum size - this fact is a *proof of the correctness of the Hegelian law*." (p76)
- *Example:* water at normal atmospheric pressure goes from a solid to a liquid at 0 degrees Celsius; then, at 100 degrees Celsius, goes from a liquid to a gas
	- The quantity, in terms of temperature, has real qualitative effects on water's state as a substance

Marx's ideas specifically:

- "And it is only after this, and in the course of still further explanations elucidating and substantiating the fact that not every petty sum of values is enough to be transformable into capital, but that in this respect each perio dof development and each branch of industry has its definite sum, that Marx observes: 'Here, as in natural science, *is shown* the correctness of the law discovered by Hegel in his *Logic*, that **merely quantitative changes beyond a certain point pass into qualitative differences**." (p76)
- Marx says: The fact that a **a sum of values can be transformed into capital only when it has reached a certain size**, varying according to the circumstance, but in each case definite minimum size - this fact is a *proof of the correctness* of the Hegelian law." (p76-77)
- "In proof of this law we might have cited hundreds of other similar facts from nature as well as from human society." (p77)
	- "Thus, for example, the whole of Part IV of Marx's *Capital* - production of relative surplus-value - deals, in the field of co-operation, division of labor and manufacture, machinery and modern industry, with innumerable caSses in which quantitative changes alsters the quality, and also qualitative change alters the quantity, of the things under consideration; in which therefore, to use the expression so hated by Herr Duhring, the quantity is transformed into quality and vice versa." (p77)
	- "As for example the fact that the co-operation of a number of people, the fusion of many forces into one single force, creates, to use Marx's phrase, a 'new power', which is essentially different from the sum of its separate forces." (p77)
		- Recall: Marx's discussion about a collective set of people being able to do way more than them isolated; animal spirits, etc., as well as concentrated means of production


## Ideas

- Use the water quantity/quality thing as an example
