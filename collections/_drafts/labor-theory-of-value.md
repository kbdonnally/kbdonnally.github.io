I don't understand what to say to people whose minds are closed to the labor theory of value. So just, hear me out.

- Value: what is it?
	- It's the concept we assign to commodities representing some intrinsic worth embedded in the object
	- Monopoly pricing must be set aside, because that leaves the problem of pricing in companies who don't have a monopoly and are thus unable to "fix" prices higher than they'd naturally be.
	- And what do we mean when we say "natural" prices, anyway?
	- So, back to the intrinsic value held by commodities: commodities contain raw materials, yes, but they also contain labor, which adds value to the commodity-in-progres.
	- Indeed, those raw materials required labor to get to the state *they* were, even if the human activity involved is merely getting it out of the ground and transporting it
	- Value certainly isn't created by Nature; Nature's fruits are free until someone claims to own them. Blackberries found while hunting in the woods bear no price. If someone chose to sell them, however, the price would reflect the labor incorporated in the product (i.e., the labor expended to pick the berries).
- All commodities can be split into constant capital (raw materials and auxiliary materials) and variable capital (the cost of labor). The reason why commodities further down the supply chain cost more per unit is because additional labor has been incorporated in them at each stage. More "layers" of variable capital - of labor power - are incorporated at each step.
	- More raw material may be added as well, but more labor will *definitely* be added, or it would not count as a step in the process; it would be the mere addition of raw ingredients in the step before or after the one in question.
- To put it bluntly: all value is created by labor. The price of a good may be much higher than its value (see: luxury clothing lines, monopoly enterprises), but the good nonetheless has a certain amount of value in it, reflecting the labor incorporated into it as people work on it.
- Value can be put in two different terms:
	1. The hours put into creating the good (sum of labor added at each step).
	2. The monetary price of the good (the "money-name" - Marx), reflecting the price of raw materials and labor. (The former method also incorporates the raw materials, but as layers of labor added on step-by-step, rather than all at once in the raw/intermediate materials.)
- *Value* is a quality of a commodity corresponding to a money-name, price. It is derived from the human labor activity incorporated into it at each step in its production.

*NB: Have a drawing with all the layers being added. Can just use Marx's example with the spindle etc. Also, find Marx's quotes on this.*
